# Viola-Jones-Face-Detector
This project implements the viola jones face detector using open-cv and cascade classifiers.It is a complete xcode project and it also counts the FPS.The project is made using C++,Cmake and Xcode.
Pretrained classifiers are used provided by the OpenCV library.The XML files are obtained from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data.
# Theory 
The detailed theory of the cascade classifier can be found at https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html
